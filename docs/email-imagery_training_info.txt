Hi ***,

You can access the web based imagery training program here:
http://wertheimer.dartmouth.edu

Your assignment is to do 20 training sessions at that site over the next four weeks.  Each session lasts about 30 minutes.  You can do up to one session each day, so that would mean about five days a week to finish in four weeks (or every day if you want to finish sooner).

We'll schedule the followup sessions when you get close to finishing.

The training program should be pretty self-explanatory, but please let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks!
Alex
