Start on Experiment?

Hi ***,

Are you still interested in participating in our longitudinal experiment?  If so, would you be available for the first 2 hour scan and first behavioral session sometime this upcoming week?

Just to make sure you have all the info: participation involves two hour-long sessions where you take some paper and pencil + computer tests (before and after), two 2-hour-long sessions in the fMRI scanner (before and after), and 20 ~30-minute training sessions over ~four weeks.  Depending on which group you are randomly assigned to, you will either study a language or practice mental imagery tasks.  Total compensation is about $300.

Thanks!
Alex
