Scott, we would love to have you participate if you are interested.  Participation involves two hour-long sessions where you take some paper and pencil + computer tests (before and after), two two-hour-long sessions in the fMRI scanner (before and after), and 20 ~30-minute training sessions over ~four weeks.  Depending on which group you are randomly assigned to, you would either be studying a language or practicing mental imagery tasks.  Total compensation is about $300.

If you are interested, when do you think you could start?  We will begin data collection again right after the new year.
