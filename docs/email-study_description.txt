Participate in an Experiment?

Hi ***,

*** told us you might be interested in participating in a longitudinal study in our lab.  We would love to have you participate if you are interested!

The study involves two 2-hour-long sessions in the fMRI scanner (before and after), two 1 hour 15 minute sessions where you take some paper and pencil/computer tests (before and after), and 20 ~30 minute training sessions over ~four weeks that you do on your own over the web.  Depending on which group you are randomly assigned to, you will either study a language or practice mental imagery tasks.  Total compensation is a little over $300.

Do you have any questions about participating?

If you are interested, when do you think you can start?  We would love it if we could do your first fMRI scan ***.

Thanks!
Alex
