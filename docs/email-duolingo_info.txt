Hi ***,

Attached are your instructions for duolingo.  Let me know if you have any questions or anything is unclear.

Your assignment is to do 20 training sessions at that site over the next four weeks.  Each session should last about 30 minutes.  You can do up to one session each day, so that would mean about five days a week to finish in four weeks (or every day if you want to finish sooner).

Make sure you keep a log of your activity at http://wertheimer.dartmouth.edu.

We'll schedule the followup sessions when you get close to finishing.

Thanks!
Alex
