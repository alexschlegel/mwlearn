sg2 has vitamin E pill on left side of head

db fMRI 1: durinng run 9 (GridOp_05) the scan stopped. I (Kevin) stopped the
matlab program with cntrl-c and restarted both the scan (run 10, still GridOp_5)
and go.Run. The scan stopped again, this time with the error "Head coil 
disconnected?". Called Terry and he suggested unplugging the headcoil and 
plugging back in (Apparently the heavy use of the scanner this weekend caused 
the head coil to come loose). Did this and restarted (run 11) and everything 
worked fine. On run 18 (GridOp_12) the same error came up, solved the same way 
and restarted. Runs 9, 10, and 18 were not exported.

ms fMRI 1: had an allergic reaction (hives) during scanning and was very uncomfortable and moving quite a bit.
lz behav1: participant has completed Raven's Progressive Matrices before.

ml fMRI 2: had to use restroom after 4th EPI run (scan 8). Reran scout and ref (scans 9/10) and continued afterward
cj1 behav1: Participant has completed Raven's Progressive Matrices before.
